# Credit Score Prediction

# Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict an individual's credit score based on financial and demographic data. The model provides valuable insights for financial institutions to assess creditworthiness effectively, helping them make data-driven decisions about lending and credit risk.

# Objectives
- Build a predictive model for accurate credit score classification.
- Identify key factors impacting credit scores through feature analysis.
- Support financial institutions in minimizing loan default risks.
  
# Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for modeling, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- Feature Selection: Select and engineer relevant features to improve model performance.
- Modeling: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to find the best-performing model.
- Evaluation: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure robust predictions.
  
# Results
This project delivers a machine learning model that accurately predicts credit scores, aiding financial institutions in making well-informed lending decisions.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Data preprocessing and modeling.
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Jupyter Notebook: For experimentation and documentation.
